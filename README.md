"Fast Install If Found" is a program that checks all commands used in an alias and tries to find and install them if it can find them in the appropriate repos

A personal project to make setting up dev environments with my preferred tools easier. Will support Debian (through apt, sorry apt-get people) and Arch, btw (through pacman)
